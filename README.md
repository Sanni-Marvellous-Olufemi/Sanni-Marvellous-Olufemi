Driven by purpose, I’m passionate about building tech solutions that empower communities and uplift small businesses in Africa. From vision-testing web apps to business empowerment platforms, my mission is to create tools that truly make an impact.

Currently majoring in Computer Science at Grambling State University with a 4.0 GPA, I actively participate in externships and fellowships (like PwC and Indego Africa), building real-world experience across software engineering, AI, and product design.

Outside of coding, I enjoy leading initiatives, designing intuitive interfaces, and engaging in meaningful conversations about innovation, equity, and opportunity.
